# UFC-Data-Analysis

Analyzing UFC data involves digging into fighter attributes, fight statistics, and outcomes to uncover patterns and trends. This includes examining physical characteristics like age, height, and weight, studying fight metrics such as strikes landed and submissions, and understanding how fighters win or lose (knockouts, submissions, decisions). Insights also come from comparing performance across weight classes and tracking changes in fighting styles over time.
